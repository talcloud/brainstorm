<h3>Default channel file</h3>
The <i>channel file</i> describes the sensors used for the acquisition:&nbsp;position,
orientation, name, types, etc. It can be shared between different
subjects or conditions.<br>
To estimate the source activity, you have
to compute a head model and an inverse solution for each channel file,
so if you share this channel file between several subjects or
conditons, you can decrease significantly
the computation time and the amount of hard drive space required<br><br>

<b>-&nbsp;No, use one channel file per acquisition run (MEG)</b><br>
Do not share the channel files between folders. Select this option if you
may have different sensor positions for one subject. This is usually
not the case in EEG, where the electrodes stay in place for all the
experiment. In MEG, this is a common setting: one recording session is
split in multiple acquisition runs, and the position of the subject's
head in the MEG might be different between two runs.<br><br>

<b>- Yes, use one channel file per subject (EEG)</B><br>
Share the channel file between all the sub-folders of a subject. You need to define a head position for each subject.<BR>
This is a common setting for EEG: the electrodes are in the same position for all the files recorded on one subject. <BR><BR>

<B>- Yes, use only one global channel file (EEG)</B><BR>
Share the same channel file for all the subjects and all the conditions.<BR>
This is never a recommended setting. It could be used in the case of an
EEG study where you use only standard EEG positions on a standard
anatomy, but only if you are not doing any advanced source
reconstruction. If you share the position of the electrodes between all
the subjects, it will also share the noise estimates and the source
models, which are highly dependent on the quality of the recordings for
each subject.
